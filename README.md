## üß† Abstract

In this paper, a data-driven multi-input multi-output discrete-time predictive model-free adaptive integral terminal sliding mode controller is proposed for the robotic manipulators driven by pneumatic artificial muscles with unknown models and external disturbances. First, using the concept of compact-form dynamic linearization technique, dynamics of the robotic manipulator are represented in discrete-time linear data-model form. Second, a time-delay based estimation algorithm along with an adaptive law is investigated to estimate external disturbances and pseudo-Jacobian matrix, respectively. Eventually, the proposed controller is derived based on a data-driven discrete-time integral terminal sliding function and by utilizing the concept of model-predictive controllers. The simulation results obviously clarify the efficacy of the proposed method.

## üéØ Overview

This work proposes a robust data-driven control strategy for rigid robotic manipulators actuated by pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) with unknown dynamics and disturbances. Key contributions include:
- **MIMO discrete-time predictive controller** using model-free adaptive integral terminal sliding mode concepts.
- **Dynamic linearization** to derive a linear data-model form via pseudo-Jacobian estimation with adaptive law.
- **Disturbance estimation** using a one-step delayed algorithm.
- **Finite-time convergence** ensured by nonlinear integral terminal sliding surfaces.
- **Predictive component** via receding-horizon optimization for improved tracking accuracy and robustness.
